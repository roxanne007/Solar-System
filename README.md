# 🌌 Solar System Simulation

A simple browser-based simulation of the Solar System built with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).  
Watch the Earth orbit the Sun, with its moons spinning in real-time!

## 🚀 Live Demo  
👉 [Try it here](https://roxanne007.github.io/Solar-System/)

## 🎯 Features
- Animated orbit of the Earth around the Sun
- Rotating moons with their own orbits
- Fully interactive and runs directly in the browser
- Built with p5.js and p5.sound

## 🛠️ Built With
- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)
- [p5.sound](https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound)
- JavaScript (sketch-based structure)

## 🧪 How It Works
- Earth rotates around the Sun using basic trigonometry
- Moons rotate around Earth using nested transformations
- All animation driven by `frameCount` for smooth motion
